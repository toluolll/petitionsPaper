\section{Petition analysis}
\label{sec:petition_analysis}

Given the list of petitions corresponding to campaigns about environmental and animal welfare issues on Twitter (described above), we first present an analysis on the petitions' usage within different types of public campaigns and then analyse petition presence outside of the campaign.
%Finally, we propose a model to classify success of a particular campaign petition on Twitter.

\subsection{Petitions and tweets stats}
% * Number with petitions tweet stats: number of tweets; number of urls; number of valid urls with petitions;
Table~\ref{tab:petition_tweets} includes the basic figures extracted about our list of petitions\footnote{Latest petition signatures reassessment is on 28 Jan 2016.}.
Surprisingly, we notice that failed petitions aimed to gather only about half as much signatures than successful. This observation is opposite for the Kickstarter\footnote{\url{www.kickstarter.com}} campaigns~\cite{Etter2013}, where failed campaigns have about trice as much goal as successful ones.
Furthermore, in our data about a quarter of the petitions were successful, as opposed to only the 1\% figure found by~\cite{Huang2015} across a broader range of petitions.
Overall, the tweets corresponding to the successful petitions are more likely to be passed on, i.e., they are retweeted about 4 times more frequently.

After a deeper inspection of the petition collection, we have identified that over 6\% of the petitions in our dataset have a low signature goal $S(p)$, e.g., under 1000 required signatures, out of which 13\% are identified as successful.
On the other hand, around 50\% of the petitions have a high initial goal (over \num{30000}) among which 35\% are successful.
Additionally, we have observed 39 petitions to reach over 100K signatures and 130 petitions to collect over 10K signatures.
Distribution of the petitions by their collected signatures versus their rank is shown on the Figure~\ref{fig:signatures_vs_rank} and convey Zipfian distribution.

\subsection{Petitions in public campaigns on Twitter}
% Information regarding environmental campaigns, types etc.
% Our findings:
% (a) only mobilization and single awareness; annual campaign with big number of msgs and failure rate.
% (b) doimated by the ever-growing campaigns.
% (c) Interesting examples (http://www.petitions.moveon.org/sign/legalize-hemp-farming/ - askdrh;
% https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/stop-the-fracking-cover-up-by-defra - talkfracking (fracking censorship to delete.))

Out of the 118 environmental campaigns in our dataset, only 39 campaign hashtags co-occur with a valid petition URL.
In our data, with only two exceptions, all the petitions were promoted by mobilization campaigns. The two exceptions are ``\#talkfracking'' and ``\#worldlovefordolphins'', which are both awareness campaigns.
Interestingly, the petitions with hashtags of awareness public campaigns were not directed towards a particular action but rather long term plans, e.g., preventing ``covering up'' hydraulic fracturing by some organizations, or legalizing hemp farming.

As described in the Section~\ref{sec:dataset}, the campaign corpus is also annotated according to the user engagement patterns for each campaign, and consist of the four main types: one-day campaigns, ever-growing, annual, inactive.
We have found that petitions were mainly promoted and tweeted by the ``ever-growing'' campaigns (``\#saveafricananimals'', ``\#tweet4dolphins'' etc.).
The rest $\sim$15\% of the campaigns are mainly ``inactive'' (``\#savethereef'', ``\#votegreen2015'').
Not surprisingly, ``one-day'' campaigns do not tend to use petitions as their instruments since usually they require faster actions.
Among campaigns with petition we also identified one ``annual'' campaign (``\#worldlovefordolphinsday'') that is advertising multiple ``Protect Dolphins'' petitions that tend to have a high failure rate.
Overall, there is no clear distinction between campaigns in terms of having dominantly successful petitions, however, only mobilization and ``ever-growing'' campaigns were most active in promoting petitions on Twitter.

\subsection{Campaign petitions on Twitter}
After meticulous data collection, cleaning and preprocessing, we have extracted a number of basic features from the tweets containing a petition URL.
This process is explained in Section~\ref{sec:dataset} in details.
We have build a binary decision tree classifier\footnote{ http://scikit-learn.org } over our petition set using features from the previous section and examined their effect on the overall success of the particular petitions.

On average, the tree has relatively high branching uncertainty, however, a few paths were more determined at predicting the petition success.
Unexpectedly, we have observed that the higher the signature goal, $S(p)$, of a particular petition, the more likely it is to succeed. In particular, over 92\% of the petitions with $S(p)$ higher 100K obtained the required number of signatures.
% TODO: Add some motivation, examples etc...
Moreover, the higher the average number of followers a user posting about a give campaign has, $T_3(p)$, the less likely the petition is to attain the required number of signatures.
On the contrary, the higher the average number of followers a user posting the petition URL without campaign hashtags has, $T_5(p)$, the more likely the petition is to attain the required number of signatures.
It should be noted, that the average number of followers is 10x higher for users outside of the campaign compared to the campaign activists.

\subsection{Lessons Learned}
\label{sec:discussion}
Since it is not trivial to provide step-by-step instructions on how to drive your petition to success in general, we would like to highlight major lessons learned from our analysis.

\textbf{Does petition success correlate with the number of tweets? - Yes.} We have observed uniform distribution for the petitions with 0 tweets found on \url{backtweets.com} in terms of $SignatureRate$. On the contrary, for the petitions with several tweet carrying its direct URL we have observed a very high fraction of successful ones (88\%). This effect is particularly strong when we consider only tweets without campaign hashtags. We have observed similar behavior for \url{thepetitionsite.com} petitions.

\textbf{Does the number of users posting about the petition affect its success? - Yes.} We have binned the petitions from the campaign corpus based on the $SignatureRate$, and extracted the average number of unique users posting about the petition in each bin. Figure~\ref{fig:signatures_vs_users} shows a boxer plot with 25th, 50th and 75th percentile for each bin. As a result, we have found moderate positive correlation with Pearson correlation of 0.7 for the bin mean values.

\caption{$SignatureRate$ against number of unique users posting about a petition on Twitter.}
\label{fig:signatures_vs_users}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Is it common to post (a) identical tweets without acknowledging original tweets or (b) retweet? - Retweet.} In our petition tweets dataset we have not identified any duplicated tweets, i.e., tweets that are identical. However, as it is shown in the Table~\ref{tab:petition_tweets}, a number of retweets for the successful petitions is several times greater than the failed ones.

\textbf{Which word features are more representative for tweets with successful petitions? - Uppercased.} We have discovered that tweets with successful petitions have more words and uppercased words on average, by 9\% and 12\% correspondingly. At the same time, we have compared distribution of the uppercased words between the collections of successful and failed petitions by computing relative change for each word. We define it as follows: $RelativeChange = \frac{W_{succ} - W_{fail}}{W_{fail}}$, where $W_{succ}$ and $W_{succ}$ are the counts of uppercased word $W$ for tweets with successful and failed petition correspondingly. Top words from the successful collection: ``ACTION'', ``URGENT'', ``WAZA'', ``PETITION'', ``SIGN'', while failed ones did not uppercased those at all.
