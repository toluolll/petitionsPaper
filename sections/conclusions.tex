% Future work and limitation.
% 1.
Interesting future direction is to study the user aspect of the petition promoters on Twitter. In particular, we could identify 
the relations between people signing the environmental petitions and users promoting petition on Twitter. The main difficulty here is to obtain this information of large nubmer of petition.

% 2.
For now, our analysis has binary prediction and annotation of the petition (success vs. failure). While this prediction itself can laready by helpful to both campaign creators and those who sign, the next step would be to explore time series properties of signature acquisition, as well as, give actionable feedback on how to increase number of signers.
