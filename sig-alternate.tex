% Climate change
Social media have become one of the key platforms to support the debate on climate change.
% Campaigns and e-petitioning
In particular, Twitter allows easy information dissemination when running environmental campaigns.
Yet, the dynamics of these campaigns on social platforms still remain largely unexplored.
% Role of the petitions in the environmental campaigns
In this paper, we study the success factors enabling online petitions to attain their required number of signatures.
% Petition success based on the campaign or Twitter activity
We present an analysis of e-petitions and identify how their number of users, tweets and retweets correlate with their success.
In addition, we show that environmental petitions are actively promoted by popular public campaigns on Twitter.
% Findings...
Finally, we present an annotated corpus of petitions posted by environmental campaigns together with their corresponding tweets to enable further exploration.
