@article{Pearce2014,
abstract = {In September 2013 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published its Working Group 1 report, the first comprehensive assessment of physical climate science in six years, constituting a critical event in the societal debate about climate change. This paper analyses the nature of this debate in one public forum: Twitter. Using statistical methods, tweets were analyzed to discover the hashtags used when people tweeted about the IPCC report, and how Twitter users formed communities around their conversational connections. In short, the paper presents the topics and tweeters at this particular moment in the climate debate. The most used hashtags related to themes of science, geographical location and social issues connected to climate change. Particularly noteworthy were tweets connected to Australian politics, US politics, geoengineering and fracking. Three communities of Twitter users were identified. Researcher coding of Twitter users showed how these varied according to geographical location and whether users were supportive, unsupportive or neutral in their tweets about the IPCC. Overall, users were most likely to converse with users holding similar views. However, qualitative analysis suggested the emergence of a community of Twitter users, predominantly based in the UK, where greater interaction between contrasting views took place. This analysis also illustrated the presence of a campaign by the non-governmental organization Avaaz, aimed at increasing media coverage of the IPCC report.},

@article{Olteanu2015,
abstract = {Social media is becoming more and more integrated in the distribution and consumption of news. How is news in social media different from mainstream news?   This paper presents a comparative analysis covering a span of 17 months and hundreds of news events, using a method that combines automatic and manual annotations.   We focus on climate change, a topic that is frequently present in the news through a number of arguments, from current practices and causes (e.g. fracking, CO2 emissions) to consequences and solutions (e.g. extreme weather, electric cars).   The coverage that these different aspects receive is often dependent on how they are framed---typically by mainstream media. Yet, evidence suggests an existing gap between what the news media publishes online and what the general public shares in social media.  Through the analysis of a series of events, including awareness campaigns, natural disasters, governmental meetings and publications, among others, we uncover differences in terms of the triggers, actions, and news values that are prevalent in both types of media. This methodology can be extended to other important topics present in the news.},

@article{Ferragina2015,
abstract = {Hashtags, originally introduced in Twitter, are now becom-ing the most used way to tag short messages in social net-works since this facilitates subsequent search, classification and clustering over those messages. However, extracting in-formation from hashtags is difficult because their composi-tion is not constrained by any (linguistic) rule and they usu-ally appear in short and poorly written messages which are difficult to analyze with classic IR techniques. In this paper we address two challenging problems regard-ing the " meaning of hashtags " — namely, hashtag relatedness and hashtag classification — and we provide two main con-tributions. First we build a novel graph upon hashtags and (Wikipedia) entities drawn from the tweets by means of topic annotators (such as TagME); this graph will allow us to model in an efficacious way not only classic co-occurrences but also semantic relatedness among hashtags and entities, or between entities themselves. Based on this graph, we design algo-rithms that significantly improve state-of-the-art results upon known publicly available datasets. The second contribution is the construction and the public release to the research community of two new datasets: the former is a new dataset for hashtag relatedness, the latter is a dataset for hashtag classification that is up to two orders of magnitude larger than the existing ones. These datasets will be used to show the robustness and efficacy of our ap-proaches, showing improvements in F1 up to two-digits in percentage (absolute).},

@article{An2014,
abstract = {To bring their innovative ideas to market, those embarking in new ventures have to raise money, and, to do so, they have often resorted to banks and venture capitalists. Nowadays, they have an additional option: that of crowdfunding. The name refers to the idea that funds come from a network of people on the Internet who are passionate about supporting others' projects. One of the most popular crowdfunding sites is Kickstarter. In it, creators post descriptions of their projects and advertise them on social media sites (mainly Twitter), while investors look for projects to support. The most common reason for project failure is the inability of founders to connect with a sufficient number of investors, and that is mainly because hitherto there has not been any automatic way of matching creators and investors. We thus set out to propose different ways of recommending investors found on Twitter for specific Kickstarter projects. We do so by conducting hypothesis-driven analyses of pledging behavior and translate the corresponding findings into different recommendation strategies. The best strategy achieves, on average, 84{\%} of accuracy in predicting a list of potential investors' Twitter accounts for any given project. Our findings also produced key insights about the whys and wherefores of investors deciding to support innovative efforts.},

@article{Tufekci2013,
abstract = {The emergent new media ecology which integrates participatory media into the structure of global information flows has fundamentally affected the means of production and distribution of attention, a key resource for social movements. In social movement scholarship, attention itself is rarely examined directly; rather, it is encountered in the study of means of delivering attention such as mass media or celebrities. This conflation of the resource, attention, and the pathways to acquire it, such as mass media, was less of an analytic problem when mass media enjoyed a near monopoly on public attention. However, the paths connecting movement actors and public attention are increasingly multiplex and include civic and social media. In this article, I examine the concept of attention as a distinct analytic category, reevaluate social movement scholarship in light of weakening of the monopoly on public attention, and introduce and examine a novel dynamic brought about by emergent attention economy: networked microcelebrity activism. I examine this novel dynamic through case studies and raise questions for future exploration. © 2013 SAGE Publications.},

@article{Etter2013,
abstract = {Crowdfunding websites such as Kickstarter are becoming increasingly popular, allowing project creators to raise hun- dreds of millions of dollars every year. However, only one out of two Kickstarter campaigns reaches its funding goal and is successful. It is therefore of prime importance, both for project creators and backers, to be able to know which campaigns are likely to succeed. We propose a method for predicting the success of Kick- starter campaigns by using both direct information and so- cial features. We introduce a first set of predictors that uses the time series of money pledges to classify campaigns as probable success or failure and a second set that uses informa- tion gathered from tweets and Kickstarter’s projects/backers graph. We show that even though the predictors that are based solely on the amount of money pledged reach a high accuracy, combining them with predictors using social features enables us to improve the performance significantly. In particular, only 4 hours after the launch of a campaign, the combined predictor reaches an accuracy of more than 76{\%} (a relative improvement of 4{\%})},

abstract = {Public perceptions of climate change are traditionally measured through surveys. The exploding popularity of social networks, however, presents a new opportunity to research the spatiotemporal pattern of public discourse in relation to natural and/or socio-economic events. Among the social networks, Twitter is one of the largest microblogging services. The architecture of Twitter makes the question “what's happening?” the cornerstone of information exchange. This inspired the notion of using Twitter users as distributed sensors, which has been successfully employed in both the natural and social sciences. In 2012 and 2013, we collected 1.8 million tweets on “climate change” and “global warming” in five major languages (English, German, Russian, Portuguese, and Spanish). We discuss the geography of tweeting, weekly and daily patterns, major news events that affected tweeting on climate change, changes in the central topics of discussion over time, the most authoritative traditional media, blogging, and the most authoritative organizational sources of information on climate change referenced by Twitter users in different countries. We anticipate that social network mining will become a major source of data in the public discourse on climate change.},
